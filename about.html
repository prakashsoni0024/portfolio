      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a passionate and self-motivated web developer with experience in building interactive websites using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. I have worked on several projects like a Traffic Light Simulation, Weather Finder (Weathersphere), To-Do List, Stone Paper Scissors Game, Currency Converter, and a Zomato Clone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to web development, Iâ€™m actively learning <strong>Java programming language</strong> and regularly solving <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong> problems to strengthen my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces and constantly strive to improve my technical and analytical abilities.
